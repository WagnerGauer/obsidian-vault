A class in JavaScript is a blueprint for creating [[objects]] that share a common structure and behavior. It servers as a template that defines a set of [[properties]] and [[methods]], which are grouped together under the class's name.

Some of the most relevant [[class methods]] are  [[static methods]], [[instance methods]], [[getter methods]] and [[setter methods]].
